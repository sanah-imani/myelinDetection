# myelinDetection

The overall goal of this project is to build a framework to automate/semi-automate the process of detecting myelin given the relevant electron microscopy (EM) and segmentation data. 

This could then play a role in discriminating between myelin distribution in inhibitory and excitatory neurons and perhaps even explaining electrophysiological properties of certain neural cells of interest.
